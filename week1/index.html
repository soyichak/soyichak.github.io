        <p>This is the reflection after reading "As We May Think" by Vannev Ar Bush</p>
        <ol style="color:darkslategray;font-size: 16px;">
            <li><em>Historical Significance: </em>Bush wrote just after WWII, when science had been used for destruction. He urged scientists to turn their talents toward peace by making knowledge more accessible. His essay became a landmark call to rethink the role of science in society.</li>
            <li><em>Analysis: </em>Bush recognized the paradox of progress: more knowledge can also mean more confusion, but instead of slowing research, he argued for better tools to support thinking and memory. In doing so, he treated knowledge not as a static archive but as a living network, where meaning emerges through the connections we create.</li>
            <li><em>Reflection: </em>Bush was optimistic that better access to knowledge would elevate humanity, but he overlooked problems like overload, misinformation, and ethical control. Reading his essay now, Iâ€™m impressed by how much he anticipated in the internet. His work reminds me that tools matter, but our judgment in using them matters even more.</li>
